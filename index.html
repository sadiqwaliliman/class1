    <h1>.......Section 2: HTML Knowledge
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage using elements (tags).
        Primary purpose:
        
        To structure text, images, and other media into sections, headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
        To provide the foundation upon which CSS and JavaScript build designs and interactivity.

            <h1>......Section 3: CSS Understanding
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format HTML elements.
                Purpose in web development:
                
                Controls the appearance of web pages, including colors, fonts, layouts, and responsiveness.
                Separates content (HTML) from design, enabling more flexible and maintainable web development.
                Helps create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

                    <h1>......Section 4: JavaScript and Its Importance
                        JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites.
                        Why itâ€™s crucial:
                        
                        Enables user interactions like form validation, animations, and real-time updates without refreshing the page.
                        Powers client-side (in-browser) and server-side applications (with tools like Node.js).
                        Enhances user experience by creating responsive and interactive interfaces.

                            <h1>......Section 5: Introduction to React and Node.js
                                React:
                                A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
                                
                                Allows developers to create reusable UI components.
                                Efficiently updates and renders components for dynamic web applications.
                                Node.js:
                                A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for server-side development.
                                
                                Allows JavaScript to run on the server, enabling full-stack development using one language.
                                Ideal for building scalable, high-performance web applications.
